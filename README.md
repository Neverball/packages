### Reshaun Anime Levels (2024-08-21)

Reshaun Anime Levels is a faithful remake of the Super Monkey Ball Gaiden custom level pack. Regrettably, the original author was not credited or informed. I was [asked to take these remakes down by Cutsman](removals/gaiden.png), the original author of the SMB Gaiden level pack.
